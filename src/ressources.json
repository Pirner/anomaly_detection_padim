    "introduction_text": "Welcome to the GUI of anomaly detection using PaDim. \nThis application has the purpose to lead through each of the 3 steps which is necessary to train, calibrate and detect anomalies in image datasets. \n\n1) train on non-anomalous data\n2) calibrate on a control group of non-anomalous data for setting the threshold\n3) detect anomalies on real samples",
    "training_step_text": "(1) Training\n\nprovide a folder which consists of .png images which have no anomalies. Then navigate to the 'train' page which provides you with a buttton on the top left 'Set Train Path'. After selecting the train path a couple of images are displayed, check if those images are the ones you want to train for. Hit the 'train' button to start the training process.\n\nThe training process will take some time, wait until the status light on the says 'ADStatus.calibrated'.",
    "calibration_step_text": "(2) Calibration\n\nprovide another folder of .png images which have no anomalies. This dataset can be significantly smaller than the original training set, as it is used to set the threshold from when to start flagging out anomalies.\n\nAfter the calibration done the system is ready to use.",
    "detection_step_text": "(3) Detect Anomalies\n\nFor detecting anomalies change to the 'Inspect' page which allows to load single images and produces anomaly accordingly."
